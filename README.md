# Home Assistant Add-ons

This repository provides links to some Home Assistant Add-ons I need to link to my Home Assistant instance. These add-ons aren't neccesarily of my own!
There are some links (Git submodules) to add-ons created by others. I use this reposity, as I want to use different versions of these linked add-ons
or original repositories have their issues I need to workaround.

## Contained add-ons
